                <p>Attributes
Each of the three Attributes are used in different circumstances. (See Saves, below.)

Strength (STR): Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
Dexterity (DEX): Used for saves requiring poise, speed, reflexes, dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
Willpower (WIL): Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.
Saves
A save is a roll to avoid negative outcomes from risky choices. Characters roll a d20 and compare the results to the appropriate attribute. If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they succeed. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.
If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.
If two characters need to take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save (usually the character with the lowest relevant Attribute).
Healing & Recovery
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but may leave the party exposed. Bandages can stabilize a character that has taken critical damage.
Attribute loss (see Critical Damage) can usually be restored with a week’s rest, facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
Some healing services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.
Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is Deprived. Anyone Deprived for more than a day adds Fatigue to their inventory, one for each day. A Deprived PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or item slots from Fatigue.
A PC may also be forced to add Fatigue after casting spells or due to events occurring in the fiction. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full night’s rest in a safe spot).
If a character is forced to add Fatigue to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.
Armor
Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s Armor value from the result of damage rolls.
Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits, depending on the fiction.
A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armor.
Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

2	3-5	6-8	9-11	12
Hostile	Wary	Curious	Kind	Helpful
Morale
Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
Some groups may use their leader’s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they’re reduced to 0 HP.
Morale does not affect PCs.
Hirelings
Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.
To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the Hirelings table in the Marketplace. Roll 3d6 for each attribute and 1d6 for their HP. Give them equipment appropriate to their station, then roll on the Character Traits tables to further flesh them out.
Alternatively, choose an appropriate background and name from the Character Creation guide. Roll (or choose from) the tables for that background. Then roll for Rations, Gold Pieces, Attributes, HP, and age.
Die of Fate
Optionally, roll 1d6 whenever the outcome of an event is uncertain or to simulate an element of randomness and chance.
A roll of 4 or more generally favors the PCs, while a roll of 3 or under usually means bad luck for the PCs.
Combat
Rounds
A Round is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and and proceeds with each side taking turns. Each round starts with any PC that is able to act, followed by their opponents. The result of each side’s actions occur simultaneously.
During the first round of combat, each PC must make a DEX save in order to act. Special circumstances, abilities, items, or skills may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round.
Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends. The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.
Actions
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, moving for a second time, or some other reasonable action. Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP. Attacks in combat automatically hit.
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. All actions are declared before being resolved.
If an attack would take a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the Scars table to see how they are uniquely impacted.
Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is Impaired, and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attacks damage die. Unarmed attacks always do d4 damage.
If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is Enhanced, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.
Attacks with the Blast quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. This can be anything from explosions to a dragon’s breath or the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result (denoted with a plus symbol, e.g. d8+d8).
Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target’s HP below zero is subtracted from their STR by the amount of damage remaining. The target must then immediately make a STR save to avoid taking Critical Damage, using their new STR score. On a success, the target is still in the fight (albeit with a lower STR score) and must continue to make critical damage saves when incurring damage.
Any PC that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid (such as bandages), they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour. NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage save are considered dead, per the Warden’s discretion. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.
Attribute Loss
If a PC takes damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an Attribute, typically STR.
If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.
Character Death
When a character dies, the player should create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.
Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single Detachment. When a detachment takes Critical Damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.
Attacks against detachments by individuals are impaired (excluding blast damage). Attacks against individuals by detachments are enhanced and deal blast damage.
Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.
Ranged Attacks
Ranged weapons can target any enemy near enough to see the whites of their eyes. Attacks against especially distant targets are Impaired.
Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.
Scars
If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to exactly 0, look up the result on the table below based on the amount of HP lost in the attack. For example, if a PC went from 3 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).</p>
